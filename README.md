# Prediction Loan Grade from Lending Club Data 


**Contributors:** Bipasha Kundu, Sudipta Paul and Noah Wong

**Platform:** Python
## Used Libraries:
* Data Analysis and cleaning: Pandas, NumPy, SciPy 
* Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
* Machine Learning: Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn

## Files included:
* Presentation Slides
* Dataset [1] 
* Python Code
  * Data Preprocessing- This includes statistical data analysis, data visualization, and data cleaning. Exported the cleaned data to be used by the other two files 
  * Exploratory Analysis- Includes further data analysis, and data visualization on the cleaned data 
  * Machine Learning Algorithms- Applied Logistic Regression (From Scratch), Decision Tree, KNN, Random Forest, and Deep Neural Network 

## Code
The code was written in Python. To run the code you need to download the data file from Kaggle. Then download the Data Preprocessing file and change the path name under the “Import Data File” section to "accepted_2007_to2018Q4.csv". Then you can run this file. It will export a new data file called “Accepted.csv” which is the clean and organized dataset. Now you can run the other two python files. Again change the file name in the “Import Data File” section. Then you should be able to run both files. Exploratory Analysis will run very quickly, but the Machine Learning Algorithms take a long time to run.
