# Prediction Loan Grade from Lending Club Data 


**Contributors:** Bipasha Kundu, Sudipta Paul and Noah Wong

## Files included:
* Presentation Slides
* Dataset [1] 
* Python Code
  * Data Preprocessing- This includes statistical data analysis, data visualization, and data cleaning 
  * Exploratory Analysis- 
  * Machine Learning Algorithms- Reads in clean data and creates the different machine learning models

## Code
The code was written in Jupyter Notebooks. To run the code you need to download the data file from Kaggle. Then download the Data Preprocessing file and change the path name under the “Import Data File” section to "accepted_2007_to2018Q4.csv". Then you can run this file. It will export a new data file called “Accepted.csv” which is the clean and organized dataset. Now you can run the other two python files. Again change the file name in the “Import Data File” section. Then you should be able to run both files. Exploratory Analysis will run very quickly, but the Machine Learning Algorithms take a long time to run.

## Python Libraries
To run the python files you will have to have the following libraries 
Data Processing- (Pandas, Numpy)
Machine Learning Libraries- (Keras, Tensorflow, Scikit-learn)
Data Visualization- (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
